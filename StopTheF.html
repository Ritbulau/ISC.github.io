            How long has the game been in development?
            Development has been ongoing since March 2023 and is expected to conclude in 2025.

            What makes Stop The F different from other puzzle platformers?

                Unique retro-inspired art style reminiscent of classic games.

                Original gameplay mechanics that redefine the genre.

                Regular post-launch updates to keep the experience fresh.
                This is just a glimpse of what sets our game apart!

            What is the goal of the project?
            The project aims to reimagine F-stop, a canceled prequel to Valve’s Portal. While Stop The F draws direct inspiration from it, it is ultimately an original creation by an indie team, crafted with its own vision and identity.

            What platforms will the game release on?
            The game is 100% confirmed for Steam (Windows and Linux). Other platforms, including macOS and consoles, are under consideration.

            What is the game’s setting?
            The game immerses players in a retrofuturistic underground science complex, blending vintage aesthetics with futuristic sci-fi elements.

            What engine is the game built on?
            The game is being developed in Unity.

            Will the game be localized into languages other than English?
            Yes, but not all languages will be supported at launch. If you’re passionate about translating the game into your native language, please contact us through any of the methods provided below!

            Are there plans for post-launch support?
            After release, we will continue to support the game with major updates to enhance its unique gameplay experience. Additionally, we plan to develop new games in the future.

            How can I contact you?
